# Screenshot Utilities

_Screenshot Utilities_ is a self-explanatory mod that adds a few nice utility features when you're taking screenshots.

When you take a screenshot with this mod enabled, a nice little screen will show up with a couple options on what to do with it next. You can...
- **Change the file name that the image is being saved to.** If you find yourself with a lot of screenshots with names that look really similar, and you can't tell them apart, this will prove pretty useful, as it allows you to change what name the file is saved under!
- **Copy the image to your clipboard.** If you're the type of person to take screenshots and immediately want to send them to your friends over _insert messaging platform here,_ this gives you an easy way to get your image straight into your clipboard and do just that!
- **Discard the image.** Very useful if you're the type who often accidentally takes screenshots. _(you're not alone if you are, I do too!)_ This allows you to discard screenshots you don't like or didn't mean to take. This also works well with the copy utility, if you want to take a quick screenshot to send to your friends but don't want it to keep sitting around in your file system.

## A guide to the screen
There are just four things on the screen. Nice and simple!
- A text field where you can specify what name you want your file to save under.
- The "Save" button, which just saves the file under whatever name you put in, or just how Minecraft normally saves screenshots if you left it blank. You can also press `Enter` to save the file.
- The "Copy to Clipboard" button, which copies the file to your clipboard. Sometimes this button may be greyed out and unavailable, which is something you should yell at me at to fix. You can do `Ctrl` + `C` if you hate your mouse.
- The "Discard" button, which gets rid of the screenshot, which can also be done with `Esc`.

## Further improvements for future me
I would like to add a sort of "screenshot display" on the screen, to show the player what the screenshot they just took looks like. I currently am skill issuing, so I cannot right now, but I'm looking to other mods to see how they've done it. At the moment, this isn't an issue in singleplayer, because the game will just pause in this screen, but in multiplayer, the game would keep going, so you don't get to see how your screenshot looks.

## Thanks for reading to the end!
